        <h2><span style="color: red;" >Objection!</span>I think egg tart is the best and the most iconic food in Hong Kong.</h2>

        <h3>What is egg tart (Cantonese called Daat Tart)?</h3>
        <p>One of the world-famous pastries in Hong Kong! Hong Kong egg tart is unlike European custard tarts. It is a variation of the British custard tart. Hong Kong-style egg tarts consist of an eggy custard centre with a pastry crust. There are many bakeries and dim sum restaurants that prepare their tarts using a flaky puff pastry crust with multiple layers. However, some bakers pay homage to the tart's Western history by using a buttery shortbread crust.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>There are many coverages posted online about the last governor of the Hong Kong colonial; Chris Patten, who is obsessed with Hong Kong-style Egg Tarts. A freshly baked egg tart from his favourite bakery shop in Hong Kong was the most important thing to do before the handover. What significant evidence shows how iconic the egg tart is compared with the pineapple bun? </li>

            <li>Huge number of Fans. They even make streams of graphics, stickers and merchandise based on egg tarts.</li>
